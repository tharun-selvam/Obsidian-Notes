1. Notes
	- Only 12 notes
	- White keys are named A - G
	- Black keys are named sharp and flat
	- 12 keys together are is called an octave
	- The 12 keys repeat with increasing pitch
2. Keys or Scale
	- Keys are combinations of notes
	- Major keys are C major and C minor which have 7 notes

1. Tempo : The speed at which your patterns play back is called the _tempo_. Tempo is measured in _beats per minute_ or _BPM_. So if we talk about a piece of music being "at 120 BPM," we mean that there are 120 beats (pulses) every minute.
	- Different genre have different tempo

 2. Backbeats:  This combination of four-on-the-floor kicks with backbeat claps or snares is commonly used in many genres such as techno and house.

 3. Bar: A bar is a group of four beats


## Notes and Scales
1. Pitch (or notes): A, C, D, E, G are the five common pitches 
2. Most music is in a particular _key_. If we say that a song is "in the key of C," this means that the pitch C sounds like the most stable “home note” (or _tonic_) for the song.
3. Scale: A collection of notes in order from lowe to high. Most songs use notes within a particular scale
	- You can think of a scale as something like an artist's palette of paint. 
	- It's a subset of all available notes, chosen because of the way they relate to each other.
	- Each type of scale has a distinct sound, and many people have particular emotional associations with particular scales.
	- You can build scales by adding more notes at specific distances (or _intervals_) above the tonic. 
	- The two most common types (or _qualities_) of scales are major and _minor_.
 
4. Minor scale: Most people hear minor scale as sad.
5. **Important**
	- Most music makes use of only smaller subsets of these 12 notes (such as the seven notes of the major or minor scales), and we're used to hearing music with this smaller number of pitches.

## Chords
1. Chord: 
	- A chord is a group of multiple pitches that play at the same time.
	- The most common chords are _triads_, which are built by adding the third and fifth notes in the scale above a starting note (or _root_).
 2. Major Triad:
	- For example, in C major, the triad built on C contains:
		- C (the root)
		- E (the third note above C; often called just "the third")
		- G (the fifth note above C; often called just "the fifth")
	- As with major scales, most people hear major triads as "happy" or "uplifting."
 3. Minor triad:
	- In C minor, the triad on C is built the same way:
		- C (the root)
		- E♭ (the third note above C; often called just "the third")
		- G (the fifth note above C; often called just "the fifth")
  4.  Non-chord tones that are between two adjacent chord tones are called passing tones.
  5. Chord Progression:
	  - But combining (or _harmonizing_) the melody with some chords helps to fill out the texture. 
	  - This is an example of a simple _chord progression_: a series of chords played in a particular order. In many types of music, chord progressions are used to create a sense of tension and release, by moving away from the tonic of the song and then back again.
	 - But there's another principle at work here; these chords are built on the first and fifth notes of the scale (F and C). You can call these chords the _1_ and _5_ chords, respectively. Chord progressions that alternate between 1 and 5 create a strong sense of departure and arrival, tension and release. Compare the "stable" and "grounded" sound of the 1-chord passages with the "tense" and "unfinished" sound of the 5-chord passages.
  6. Basically 1, 5 chord progression means that the chords are built on the *first* and *fifth* notes of a particular scale. Built means that the chord has that particular note as it's starting point.
